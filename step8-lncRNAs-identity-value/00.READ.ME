# Step 4-1
""
This Python script is to calculate the identity value for the lncRNAs of reference species.

Parameters and directories to be specified:

- template_inputdir_maflist: The directory that contains the .maflist files, which are the output from a previous step2.
- template_inputfile_species_list: List the species for which you want to calculate the identity value (01.input-species-list).
- template_inputfile_gtf: The *.gtf file for sheep lncRNA (01.input-sheep-rumen-specific-high-expression-lncRNA.gtf).
- output_identity_file: The file where the identity values will be stored (01.output-identity.csv).
- output_basecount_file: The file where the number of matching nucleobases will be stored (01.output-number_of_matching_nucleobases.csv).

Usage:
1. Ensure that the required directories and files are correctly specified in the script.
2. Run the script to perform the identity value calculations for the specified species.
3. The results will be saved as *.csv files in the specified output directory.

Requirements:
- Python 3.
- Any necessary Python libraries (e.g., re, csv, concurrent.futures) should be installed.
- Access to the specified directories with read/write permissions.
