# Step 3-1
''
This Python script is to calculate the identity value for the whole genome of specified species.

Parameters and directories to be specified:

- template_inputdir: The directory that contains the .maflist files, which are the output from the previous step2.
- template_inputfile: List of the species for which you want to calculate the identity value (01.input-species-list).
- template_intermediate_dir: The directory that contains the Python and Bash scripts used to calculate the identity value for each chromosome.
- output_dir:The directory where the *.csv files are stored includes the whole genome identity values (01.output-chr1_identity_score.csv) and number of matching nucleobases (01.output-chr1_number_of_matching_nucleobases.csv).
- chromosomes: Specify the chromosomes of the species studying here.

Usage:
1. Ensure that the required directories and files are correctly specified in the script.
2. Run the script to perform the identity value calculations for the specified species.
3. The results will be saved as *.csv files in the specified output directory.

Requirements:
- Python 3.
- Any necessary Python libraries (e.g., pandas, concurrent.futures) should be installed.
- Access to the specified directories with read/write permissions.
